## Description
This is a hibernate demo project which is intended to show how hibernate framework can be used without using maven dependency handler.This project is configured using hibernate.properties file. This file contains the database type,its name, username, password and other necessary details.

Here I have used MYSQL database.

# Hibernate framework version
I have used hibernate 5.4.11. Just the user needs to download all jar files and copy them to CLASSPATH.

# MYSQL version
Also the MYSQL version which I have used is 8.0.19. User also need the MYSQL connector(jar files) of the same version and add it also to CLASSPATH.
